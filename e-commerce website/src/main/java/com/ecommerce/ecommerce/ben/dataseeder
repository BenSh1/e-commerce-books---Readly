The dreary sense that everything you’re doing is worthless—that there’s just no point in trying anymore. Mark Manson’s Everything is F*cked is a book about hope and much, much more. Manson takes the reader into existentialist territory by first reflecting on what hope is and its relationship to meaning, and then expertly painting a picture of how hope fits into the world we live in today. \n" +
                            "Mark’s writing style strikes a rare balance between witty humor and philosophical self-help. Almost creating his own genre, Manson maintains his genuine appreciation for comedy while bringing the reader life-changing information that is both discernible and interesting. Mark’s latest book is full of wisdom and is a timely piece considering the apparent lack of hope in today’s society. Here are a few of our favorite key lessons and timeless quotes from Everything is F*cked.\n",
